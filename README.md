 # FOLDER STRUCTURE AND CODE OVERVIEW
This folder contains all code and data used to complete the assignment. Below is an overview of the purpose of each file and subfolder.

## MAIN FOLDER FILES

### 1. Scenario Generation and Data Preparation
- **data_generator.py**: Generates the scenario by sampling parameters from predefined ranges and probability distributions.
- **csvimport.py**: Contains the functions used to create and import the CSV files T1, T2, and T3, which store all information describing a scenario.
- **T1.csv, T2.csv, T3.csv**: CSV files containing all data defining the scenario. These files are generated using data_generator.py and csvimport.py.

### 2. Model Definition and Execution
- **model.py**: builds the model, initializes it, definying objective funcion and constraints, solves it and reports the solution.
- **example_main.py**: Main executable file of the project. When run, it loads the scenario data from T1, T2, and T3, solves the optimization problem using the model, and writes the solution to CSV files.

### 3. Solution Output
- **solution.csv** and **solution_vars.csv**: Contain the solution of the scenario considered in the assignment. These files are automatically generated by running example_main.py.

### 4. Solution Analysis and Visualization
- **analyze_solution.py**: Reads the solution CSV files and computes overall performance metrics.
- **visualization_tool.py**: Takes the solution data as input and generates a simple animation to visualize the results.

## SENSITIVITY FOLDER
The Sensitivity folder contains all code and data related to the sensitivity analyses.

### Sensitivity Subfolders
- **Sensitivity_Scenario/**: contains T1, T2, and T3 CSV files for the sensitivity analysis scenario, and the corresponding solution CSV files.

- **Arrival_Cost/**: Contains code and results for the sensitivity analysis of the arrival delay penalty cost.
- **Buffer/**: Contains code and results for the sensitivity analysis of the space buffer parameter.
- **Departure_Cost/**: Contains code and results for the sensitivity analysis of the departure delay penalty cost.
- **Rejection/**: Contains code and results for the sensitivity analysis of the rejection penalty cost.
- **Time/**: Contains code and results for the sensitivity analysis of the minimum time gap between actions.

### Structure of Arrival_Cost, Buffer, Departure_Cost, Rejection, and Time Folders
Each of these folders contains:
- **main_***: Runs the model for multiple values of the corresponding parameter.
- **analyze_*** : Analyzes the generated solutions and produces plots summarizing the sensitivity results.
- **CSV files**: Contain the solutions for the different parameter values.
- **PNG files**: Visualizations of the sensitivity analysis results.
